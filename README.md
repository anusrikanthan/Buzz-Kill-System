# Procedure for connecting Neurosky (Windows 8 and above):
    1. Download thinkgear connector from this site http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc
    2. Use AAA batteries to power on the Neuro Sky.
    3. Install necessary drivers from the thinkgear website. 
    4. Switch on bluetooth in your machine and pair the device .
    5. Figure out the port the device is connected to using device manager.
    6. Create a twilio account from https://www.twilio.com/login?      g=%2Fconsole%3F&t=2b1c98334b25c1a785ef15b6556396290e3c704a9b57fc40687cbccd79c46a8c
    7. Update twilio account details in script "our_test.py" and update port also.
    8. Then run script "our_test.py" from the repository.
